Preface
=======
Game playing is fun, programming too, AI (Artificial Intelligence) is like a volcano, now silent but strongly working underneath, so what about programming AI to play board games? It is the best.
This work is all about playing around with an AI set of programs that play the Reversi (Othello) board game. Reversi is a very intriguing game, very easy to learn but also difficult to master, it is an excellent laboratory where we can train our skills on programming, languages, algorithms, searching and optimizing, basically all the ingredients that compose the AI field. Being Reversi a so simple game we are not bogged down by complex rules, but instead it is quite easy to sharpen different techniques to make a strong program applying consolidated best practices or experimenting new ones.
