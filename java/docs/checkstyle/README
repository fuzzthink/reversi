Class Structure and Member Sort Order

Java types should have the following member order:

   1. Nested Types (mixing inner and static classes is okay)
   2. Static Fields
   3. Static Initializers
   4. Static Methods
   5. Instance Fields
   6. Instance Initializers
   7. Constructors
   8. Instance Methods 

Members that fall into the same category (e.g. static methods) should also be sorted in this order based on visibility:

   1. public
   2. protected
   3. default
   4. private 

All methods should be sorted alphabetically. Sorting is optional but recommended for fields.
