This file describes the configuration and settings done to prepare the Common Lisp environment used to develop and execute
the REVERSI program.

Software components being used are:

 - Ubuntu distribution 12.04 (x86_64)
 - SBCL version 1.0.55.0.debian
 - GNU Emacs 24.1.1 (x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, GTK+ Version 2.24.10)
 - git version 1.7.9.5
 - Quicklisp
 - SLIME (2012-08-04)

Steps followed are:

 (1) Prepare the Ubuntu installation.

 (2) Install SBCL using the "Ubuntu Software Centre".

 (3) Install Emacs 24.2 using the "Damien Cassou" repository

Run the following commands in a terminal:

$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:cassou/emacs
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install emacs24 emacs24-el

 (4) Install Quicklisp.

Go to: http://www.quicklisp.org/beta/ and follow the instruction ... steps are:
 - Make a new appropriate directory: ~/ql_tmp
 - Download the quicklisp.lisp file and put it in the ~/ql_tmp dir
 - Open a terminal in the ~/ql_tmp dir and run "sbcl --load quicklisp.lisp"
 - Follow the instructions ... at the end you will have ~/.sbclrc file modified and a new ~/quicklisp directory

 (5) Install quicklisp-slime-helper.

Open an sbcl session and run:
 * (ql:quickload :quicklisp-slime-helper)

Add the "suggested" configurations to your ./~emacs file

Restart emacs.

Run in emacs: M-x slime. Slime should be working ... test it.

 (6) Install git using the "Ubuntu Software Centre".

 (7) Clone the REVERSI project from GitHub.

Make a ~/projects directory. Open a shell there and run: git clone https://github.com/rcrr/reversi.git reversi
If you are reading this file it is very likely that you already did this operation.

 (8) Configure ASDF

Create a directory ~/lisp and another one ~/lisp/systems
Open a terminal in ~/lisp/systems and run the following command:
$ ln -s ~/projects/reversi/reversi.asd reversi.asd

Open the ~/.sbclrc file and add the following lines:

;; asdf configuration
;; next make a symbolic link as follow: 
(pushnew #P"~/lisp/systems/" asdf:*central-registry* :test #'equal)
(push #P"~/lisp/systems/" asdf:*central-registry*)

Restart Emacs, run SLIME. Here a working session to try ....

Alternatively it is possible to start an SBCL session and start a swank server:

* (ql:quickload "swank")
* (swank:create-server :port 4006)

then in Emacs start SLIME as follow: M-x slime-connect.
