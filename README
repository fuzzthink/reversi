This is a COMMON LISP and hopefully Clojure project.

The aim is to use the PAIP (Paradigm of Artificial Intelligence Programming. Case Studies in Common Lisp) examples
that describe how to write an AI strategy to play the board game named REVERSI.

First objective is to make the code working with a current version of SBCL under Linux.

Then I have two goals, play around with the code and port it to Clojure.

The project environment is as follow:

 - Ubuntu 9.10
 - SBCL compiled from source, downloaded from  git://sbcl.boinkor.net/sbcl.git
 - Emacs compiled from source, downloaded from git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git
 - Slime downloaded from the official cvs repository

To operate the program:
From the SLIME PROMPT type:

     (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'reversi)
     (in-package :reversi)
