Reversi is a suite of programs to play the Reversi (Othello) board game.

The source code is written in Common Lisp, Clojure, Java.
The three versions share the underlaing logic and AI, taken from the PAIP book.
The CL version is the original source code plus a very limited set of adaptations.
The Clojure version is a complete rewrite that follows one by one the steps given by the text.
The Java version is a complete refactoring of the algorithms given by the CL version. On top
of it the Java version has a Graphic UI.

The program is distributed under the GNU GPLv3 license.

The steps so far completed are:

 (1) Adapt the COMMON LISP programs taken from the PAIP book to run smoothly in the two following env:

      - Ubuntu 9.10
      - SBCL compiled from source, downloaded from  git://sbcl.boinkor.net/sbcl.git
      - Emacs compiled from source, downloaded from git://git.savannah.gnu.org/emacs.git
      - Slime downloaded from the official cvs repository

      - Microsoft Windows 7
      - ABCL 

     To operate the CL program type from the REPL:

           (asdf:operate 'asdf:load-op 'reversi)
           (in-package :reversi)

     The aim is to use the PAIP (Paradigm of Artificial Intelligence Programming. Case Studies in Common Lisp) examples
     that describe how to write an AI strategy to play the board game named REVERSI.

 (2) Translate the CL code into Clojure.

      - This work is almost complete.
         The basic game rules are working. The minimax and alpha-beta functions are ok.
	 Unit tests are close to be complete, minimax test function is under construction.
	 The complete translation of advanced tecniques is complete (Reversi tournament, and Iago strategy).

 (3) Revrite the CL code into Java.

      - This work is almost complete.
         The complete set of function have been developed.
         A very extensive set of test cover the complete codebase.
         A GUI has been added. For it a complete refactoring is needed, as long as a test suite.

     To build the software follow those steps:

       - Make sure you have a JDK 6 or newer installed
       - Make sure you have ANT installed
       - cd $REVERSI_PROJECT_HOME/java
       - ant

     To operate the program run:

       - java -cp ./lib/joda-time-2.0.jar:./build/jar/JavaReversi.jar rcrr.reversi.ui.ReversiUI

 (4) Future lines of development that currently are appealing, could be:

      - Profile the Java, CL and Clojure versions. Optimize for speed the critical components.
      - Port the program to more languages (Scala, Jython, JRuby).
      - Prepare the build process for the Java version using maven.
      - Refactor the graphical Java Swing UI, write the test suite.
      - Redesign the Clojure implementation to be fully functional.
      - Develop a complete game analysis suite.
      - Further enhance advanced strategies, following the paper written by Rosenbloom, Lee & Mahajan, Buro.
      - Make the program leverage the multi core processors thru a redesign for parallel computing.
      - Prepare a client/server game version.
      - Write the software documentation and publish it on GitHub and as PDF documents.
      - Insert a code coverage tool like EMMA.
