This file describes the configuration and settings done to prepare the C environment used to develop and execute
the REVERSI program.

Software components being used are:

 - Ubuntu distribution 13.10 (x86_64)
 - GCC 4.8.1
 - glib 2.32.1
 - doxygen 1.8.4
 - The GNU/Linux toolchain

Run the following commands in a terminal:

$ make
$ make test
$ make doxygen

Everything is build under the ./build directory.

Two executables are created in ./build/bin:
  endgame_solver
  gpdb_verify

gpdb_verify (game position database consistency verifier) is a tool that reads and verifies a file based database of game position.
Run 'gpdb_verify -h' for help and options.
