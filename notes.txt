# 2010-04-10 (April 10th, 2010) - Running the CL round-robin tournament
After "completing" the edge-table management utilities for the iago strategy, and fixing a typo into the function piece-stability, the Common Lisp codebase is working as expected.
There is no Unit Testing, but the ability to reproduce the PAIP cases, and the result obtained below seams credible.

Iago-8 (running at an 8 ply depth) won 39, among 40, games, losing once against Iago-4. Iago-4 is well positioned between Iago-8 and Modified-Weighted-Squares-8.
Mod-Weigheted-8 is consistently beating Mod-Weighted-4, Random-Strategy was able to win just one game again Mod-Weighted-4.

It is quite clear that the two strategies Iago, and Modified-Weighted-Squares (MSW) are doing a quite accetpable work, winning almost every match against the random player.
It is also clear that the Iago strategy is superior to the MWS, and it is also proved that a "good strategy" (meaning a strategy that employee an heuristic board 
evaluation that is able to discriminate two alternative boards with a some precedence of value) behave better searching more deeply.

The case has been run into a time form, retaining some row performance indicators.
Below are reported the PC specs.
