From distant memory:

- Written in Common Lisp at Carnegie-Mellon (1985).
- Rewritten from scratch in C [see paper 3] (1986).
- Automatically trained evaluation function using Bayesian
  classification [see paper 2] (1987).
- Selective search experiments, although this code isn't in the
  distribution (1988).

And see paper 1 for probably more accurate history information!
