This directory contains programs to generate tables that:
	Convert an index that is generated from the pieces on a "line",
where a line can be a combination (like a 5+3 or a 4+4) or a normal line (8,
7, or 6 square lines), to an unsigned char representing the legal moves on
that line.  A bit in position x represents whether a legal move is possible
to sqaure x: 1 for yes, 0 for no.
	tobyte.c is the file that contains all the data.  It has been
removed.  To recreate it, do
	mv_gen > tobyte.c
	The arrays are named as follows:
		tobyte??[size], with ?? being one of 44,53,60,70, or 80.
