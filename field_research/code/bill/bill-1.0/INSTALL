Bill is a strong Othello program, written by Kai-Fu Lee, Sanjoy
Mahajan, and Joe Keane.  It is copyright under the GNU GPL v2 (see the
file COPYING) or, at your option, any later version.

It certainly has bugs.  We hope it is useful to you.


QUICK START
-----------

	./configure
	make

Then read the 'Help' file for how to run Bill.

LONGER STORY
------------

This package uses the GNU autoconfiguration stuff (i.e. a ./configure 
shell script generated from configure.in by the autoconf program).

To build Bill:

Step 0: Make sure you are in the root directory of the distribution.
	It will have subdirectories such as ab, search, and io.
Step 1: ./configure
	[Don't worry about any errors relating to ./ios/GNUmakefile.in
	 Those files, to connect Bill to IOS, are not included with this
	 standard distribution.]
Step 2: make or gmake (or whatever you call GNU make)

You need GNU make, and a version of `cc' which can accept function
prototypes (ANSI C).  'gcc' works well, as does `cc' on SGI IRIX64.
The configure script checks that these requirements are satisifed.  If
you don't like the default that configure uses for optimization, you
can do for example (Bourne shell)
	CFLAGS=-O2 ./configure
or, if you have the `env' program (this command works for the C-shell)
	env CFLAGS=-O2 ./configure
Similarly, you can choose the C compiler by setting the CC environment
variable.

`make' in the root directory will make the tables.a archive in the
tables/ subdirectory, then make the `Bill' executable.  After Bill is
successfully built, you can type `make clean' to get rid of the object
files and library files.  `make dist' will make a .tar.gz distribution
of Bill in the parent directory (it'll be ../bill-dist.tar.gz).  Be
warned that the `make dist' command deletes, among other things, the
`Bill' executable.

Hardware/OS combinations that I've successfully tested Bill on:

Sparc 10	SunOS 4.1.4
i586		Linux 2.0.27
SGI		Irix64 6.2

Once I entered an old version of Bill in a tournament, running on an
Alpha, and it worked fine, but I haven't tried it recently.
