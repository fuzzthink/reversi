This directory contains a collection of open source code collected on internet,
related to the subject of the Reversi project.

The software is "as-is" and may even do not compile.

(1) improved_fast_endgame_solver
    A single source file written by Gunnar Andersson and last modified on July 13, 1999.
    The program, as stated by Gunnar, was created by Warren Smith and later improved by
    Jean-Christophe Weill.
    The code compiles and runs fine.

(2) solver
    A single source file written by Richard Delorme, the author of Edax (http://abulmo.perso.neuf.fr).
    The program, released under the GNU General Public License V2+, is an endgame solver, too.
    The code compiles and runs fine.

(3) zebra
    The zebra program written by Gunnar Andersson.
    The software is ditributed by means of the GNU General Public License V2.
    The code compiles and scrzebra, the tool dedicated to endgame solving, run perfectly.

(4) edax
    Edax 4.3 program written by Richard Delorme (http://abulmo.perso.neuf.fr/index.htm).
    The software is distributed by means of the GNU General Public License V3.
    The code builds perfectly on my linux/x64/gcc box. The executable runs fine.
    Left out of this repository are de html documenattion, that can be simply rebuild by running doxygen,
    precompiled binaries, the bin/pthreadGC2.dll, the problem ffo files, and averall most important, the two
    data file: eval.dat and book.dat. Those wo large binary files are mandatory to run the program, are
    provided by the archive distributed by the official Edax site and are the database of precompiled info
    used by the evaluation function.

(5) bill
    Bill 1.0 released under the GPLv2, written by Sanjoy Mahajan (http://web.mit.edu/sanjoy/www/) and Kai-Fu Lee.
    About 210KB. It was once one of the strongest Othello players in the world (but now far surpassed!).
    The software is described by three accademic papers:

       1. Kai-Fu Lee and Sanjoy Mahajan.
          Development of a world-class Othello program.
          Artificial Intelligence 43:21-36 (1990).

       2. Kai-Fu Lee and Sanjoy Mahajan.
          A pattern-classification approach to evaluation-function learning.
          Artificial Intelligence 36:1-25 (1988).

       3. Kai-Fu Lee and Sanjoy Mahajan.
          BILL: A table-based, knowledge-intensive Othello program.
          Carnegie Mellon CS Dept Technical Report CMU-CS-86-141 (1986).

    The package compile fines on Linux and Windows 7 using Cygwin as long as the system is x86_32.
    Adding -m32 to CFLAGS and -m32 -L/usr/lib32 to LDFLAGS it compile fine also on Linux x86_64.
