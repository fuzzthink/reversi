    abstract = "Othello is a recent addition to the collection of games that have been examined within artificial intelligence.
                Advances have been rapid, yielding programs that have reached the level of world-championship play.
                This article describes the current champion Othello program, IAGO.
                The work described here includes: (1) a task analysis of Othello; (2) the implementation of a program based on
                this analysis and state-of-the-art AI game-playing techniques; and (3) an evaluation of the program's performance
                through games played against other programs and comparisons with expert human play."

    abstract = "We present a new approach to evaluation function learning using classical pattern classification methods.
                Unlike other approaches to game playing where ad hoc methods are used to generate the evaluation function,
                our approach is a disciplined one based on Bayesian learning. This technique can be applied to any domain
                where a goal can be defined and an evaluation function can be applied. Such an approach has several
                advantages: (1) automatic and optimal combination of the features, or terms of the evaluation function;
                (2) understanding of inter-feature correlation; (3) capability for recovering from erroneous features; and
                (4) direct estimation of the probability of winning by the evaluation function. We implemented this algorithm
                using the game of Othello and it resulted in dramatic improvements over a linear evaluation function that has
                performed at world championship level."

    abstract = "Paradigms of AI Programming is the first text to teach advanced Common Lisp techniques
                in the context of building major AI systems. By reconstructing authentic, complex AI programs
                using state-of-the-art Common Lisp, the book teaches students and professionals how to build and
                debug robust practical programs, while demonstrating superior programming style and important AI
                concepts. The author strongly emphasizes the practical performance issues involved in writing real
                working programs of significant size. Chapters on troubleshooting and efficiency are included,
                along with a discussion of the fundamentals of object-oriented programming and a description of
                the main CLOS functions. This volume is an excellent text for a course on AI programming, a useful
                supplement for general AI courses and an indispensable reference for the professional programmer."
